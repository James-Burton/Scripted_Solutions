#! Snippets to customize an Acer 311 Chromebook for GIS consulting and web development capabilties.
#! After initializing your linux virtual machine you can follow the workflow to achieve your needs.

#! TITLE: ACER 311 DEBIAN 11 BULLSEYE GIS CONSULTATION WEB DEV Workstation Customization
#! AUTHOUR: REX
#! DATE: September 2022
#! PRE-REQS: ACER 311 CHROMEBOOK with LINUX DEBIAN 11 BULLSEYE Virtual Terminal deployed.
#! NOTES: 
#! 1. FLASHED MEMORY CANNOT BE OVERWRITTEN AND DOES NOT SUPPORT LIVE BOOT USB TO USE FOSS4G OSGEO TOOL.
#! 2. AMD64
#! 3. Not everything works, and some things work without providing you with an icon resulting in terminal to launch, which isn't too bad if you make it to the end of this.
#! 4. -y after install denotes automatically accepting changes and memory usage. Remove from code if you prefer to verify everything or begin to notice depreciation in package availability.

#! SOURCES: Alot of my base knowledge comes from years of programming various Ubuntu versions, and really, I just changed may package calls from apt-get to apt and have had good success. However there are something that needed research and I would like to acknowledge the following sources for their direct (copy/paste) or indirect (modified) snippets.

#! Add buku bookmarks
buku -a https://github.com/James-Burton/solutions/edit/main/Acer311_Debian_Customization
buku -a https://linux-packages.com/debian/all-packages
buku -a https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows
#! export bookmarks to html to upload into firefox
buku -e bukumarks.html

#! install docker
sudo pip install docker-compose -y
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh

#! Install a web browser with icon .. Funny story this package is built off a package that is specific to amd64 arch while we need ard64.. Palemoon works well but requires an echo and curl to stevenpusser repo

sudo apt install firefox-esr-l10n-en-ca -y

#! install pycharm from source above. note it will be all angry with warnings about no visual studio code and eclipse but snapd installs do not work as no squashfs package for ard64
