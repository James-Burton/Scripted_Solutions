This tool was designed to replace a pre-existing automated status tool implemented provincially. 
The original tool has too many redundancies so this script was designed to reduce those factors and accelerate performance.

The tool reduced process time by ~40 minutes by calling in one feature class and running multiple selections instead of importing the same feature multiple times for singular queries.
